## Project Overview:
In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, ensuring the reliability of wafer fabrication tools is critical. Each wafer undergoes multiple processing steps, with sensor data recorded at every run. Faults in these tools can result in costly wafer scrap and production delays. To mitigate this, a **Wafer Tool Anomaly Detection and Sensor Data Management System** is designed to process, analyze and manage sensor data to detect anomalies in real-time.


## Key Objectives:
- Clean and preprocess raw sensor data.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand sensor behavior, detect outliers and identify trends.
- Design and implement a scalable database solution to store, query and manage sensor data efficiently.
- Create visualizations to present analysis insights and anomaly detection results.


## Tools:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikitlearn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL (BigQuery)
- Google Cloud Platform
- Visualization: Looker, Spreadsheet
